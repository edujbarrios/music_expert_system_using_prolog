# music_expert_system_using_prolog
This project is mainly based in the design of an expert system using logic and relational programming lenguage that works with AI, known as Prolog.

It allows you to know and display some useful information about feelings and music, this means letting everyone know, how they might be feeling, which kind (genre) of music they should listen and/or the key of songs that they should listen based on these mentioned feelings, as well as some song examples that they should take a look into to overpass (p.e sad) and/or relate accordingly with that feeling (p.e happy), asked in different and random ways, but each one of them,related and stated with music, this is the reason why it's calledd "Expert System".

This is a w.i.p project, it may be updated with more functionalities and entires on the knwoledge base in the near future, which will be supplied as commits on this github repository

HOW-TO-COMPILE:
	
	1. As you may not have a propper compiler for this language, make sure to visit this online tool:
	
	https://swish.swi-prolog.org/
	
	2. Create a new file with the '+' function 
	
	3. a) Upload the downloaded file to SWISH, using the upper left side option named as 'FILE', and then press 'upload'
	
	3. b) On Mac devices, this function doesn't work, it doesn't allow you to create an existing file, so in this cases, just copy-paste the code into the created empty file.
	
	4. On the right down side of the screen you will see a box or gap followed by this element '?-'. At the bottom, type the word 'main_menu'
	
	5. Press 'run' blue box at the right bottom side of the mentioned side of the screen
	
	6. Now the script will be running, it will start showing a random question or quote, just follow the mentioned menu part.
	
	7. Once the script finish, make sure to press 'main_menu' few times because there will be different menu options at each time where the menu gets shown
